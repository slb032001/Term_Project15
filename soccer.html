    <p>"I found out about Liquid IV through my teammates. A lot of girls on my team have sponsorships with brands like Liquid IV and Celsius so I thought I'd look into it too since I love Liquid IV. It's been so awesome, I basically just post a few pictures on my story and then I get sent monthly packages with all kinds of products. It was a really easy process to fill out the online form to become an ambassador as well."
