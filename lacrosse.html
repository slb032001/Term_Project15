    <p>"As soon as I heard that NIL deals were available for D3 athletes I started looking into which brands I might want to partner with. Mostly, I just wanted to make the most of the opportunity, and I landed upon Liquid IV. I'd had Liquid IV in the past, and I really liked it so I figured, why not? It was easy to apply to be an ambassador and posting once or twice on my story every once in a while definitely makes it worth it."
