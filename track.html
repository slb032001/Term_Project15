    <p>"I'm sponsored by Liquid IV. I found out abobut their student-athlete program through a friend of mine who received shipments from them. All I have to do is post a story on my Instagram twice a month and I receive monthly shipments from Liquid IV. And the monthly shipment contains two packages of basically any of their flavors that you can choose from. The very first time I ordered from them they also sent me a water bottle, and somewhat recently they randomly sent me a box containing one of the brand new flavor packets, a new water bottle, a pair of gymshark socks, who they have a partnership with. I've really liked having this partnership, because I enjoy the product especially when I'm in season, and it's always nice to have extra on hand!"
